# Advent of Code 2021
Just my humble attempt at solving puzzles while learning Python.

## Day 6 - Complete
Used dictionary to store previous results to reduce time cost

## Day 7 - Complete
Used dictionary to store previous results to reduce time cost

## Day 8 - Complete
Dictionaries, helper functions, and string compares to solve by process of elimination

## Day 9 - Complete
### Utilized generators and Depth First Search type recursion.
Used sets, lists, and dictionaries to keep track of search results

## Day 10 - Complete
Utilized list stack

## Day 11 - Complete
Utilized Generator function to recurse through adjacent points

## Day 12 - Complete
I needed some help wrapping my head around recursive DFS and BFS strategies. took several days to finally "get" it.

## Day 13 - Complete
This one was relatively easy! Came up with a pretty simple solution without looking at any other references.

## Day 14 - Complete

## Day 15 - Complete
Used a priority queue, such as heapq. This was a bugger to wrap my head around.

## Day 16 - Complete
This one was also brutal. I really got tripped up with the literal value parsing. All test cases worked, but I believe
that was due to luck. When I tried larger inputs, everything broke. It turns out the problem was that I was converting
each nibble (4 bits) of chunks to integers then adding them together. I should have combined them into a binary string
and then converted that entire binary string as one. Another solution would be to do a bit shift on every chunk, covert
to integer, then add those.

## Day 17 - Complete
This one was relatively easy, but I got hung up on double-counting when an object is in the target area over multiple
steps. Also, when doing boundary checking, I used range, which did not include the edge boundary.

## Day 18 - In Process
This one is a real friggin bugger. I'm approaching it differently than what I've seen from others. I almost have it.
Success!!
Holy Cow, this one was tough for me. But I finally ot it, all on my own.
